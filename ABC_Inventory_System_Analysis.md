# ABC Company Inventory Management System - SDLC Analysis

## 1. PLANNING PHASE

### Current System Analysis
- **Manual Process**: Paper-based tracking and spreadsheets
- **Locations**: Head office (City X) + 2 manufacturing plants (Cities Y & Z)
- **Problems**: 
  - Excess raw material purchases
  - Component stockouts
  - Missed production schedules
  - Inaccurate inventory data
  - Monthly manual aggregation delays

### Business Objectives
- Streamline inventory operations across all locations
- Reduce manual errors and data inconsistencies
- Enable real-time inventory tracking
- Improve production scheduling accuracy
- Enhance customer service through better availability

## 2. ANALYSIS PHASE

### Functional Requirements
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of raw materials, WIP, and finished goods
- **Multi-location Support**: Centralized system with location-specific access
- **Automated Reordering**: Prevent stockouts with automatic purchase triggers
- **Production Integration**: Link inventory levels with production schedules
- **Reporting**: Real-time dashboards and automated reports
- **User Management**: Role-based access for different departments

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle 3 locations with concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours
- **Security**: Secure data transmission between locations
- **Scalability**: Support future expansion
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface for non-technical staff

### Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Inventory control staff, production managers
- **Secondary**: Purchasing department, top management
- **External**: Suppliers (for automated ordering integration)

## 3. DESIGN PHASE

### System Architecture
- **Type**: Web-based client-server architecture
- **Database**: Centralized database at head office
- **Access**: Browser-based interface for all locations
- **Integration**: APIs for supplier systems and production equipment

### Database Design
**Core Entities:**
- Products (raw materials, components, finished goods)
- Locations (warehouses, production lines)
- Transactions (receipts, issues, transfers)
- Suppliers and Customers
- Users and Permissions

### User Interface Design
- **Dashboard**: Real-time inventory levels and alerts
- **Transaction Entry**: Barcode scanning capability
- **Reports**: Customizable reports and analytics
- **Mobile Support**: Tablet/smartphone access for warehouse staff

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Backend**: Python/Django or Java Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-based (AWS/Azure) for reliability

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Core inventory tracking (3 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Automated reordering and supplier integration (2 months)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics and mobile support (2 months)

### Data Migration Plan
- Export existing spreadsheet data
- Clean and validate data integrity
- Import into new system with verification
- Parallel running for 2 weeks

## 5. TESTING PHASE

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Multi-location data synchronization
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End-user validation at each location
- **Performance Testing**: Concurrent user load testing
- **Security Testing**: Data protection and access controls

### Test Scenarios
- Simultaneous transactions from multiple locations
- Network connectivity issues and recovery
- Large volume data processing
- User permission and security validation

## 6. DEPLOYMENT PHASE

### Deployment Plan
- **Pilot**: Start with one manufacturing plant (City Y)
- **Rollout**: Gradual deployment to remaining locations
- **Training**: Comprehensive user training program
- **Support**: 24/7 technical support during initial weeks

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup systems and data recovery procedures
- Rollback plan to manual system if needed
- Change management and user adoption strategies

## 7. MAINTENANCE PHASE

### Ongoing Support
- **Monitoring**: System performance and user activity
- **Updates**: Regular software updates and security patches
- **Enhancement**: Continuous improvement based on user feedback
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with disaster recovery

### Success Metrics
- Inventory accuracy improvement (target: >98%)
- Reduction in stockouts (target: <5%)
- Faster monthly reporting (target: real-time)
- User satisfaction scores (target: >85%)
